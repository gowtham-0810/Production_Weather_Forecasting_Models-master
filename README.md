A full-stack machine learning application that provides localized weather forecasts for Sydney, Australia. The project utilizes a **FastAPI** backend for model inference and a **Streamlit** frontend for user interaction.

## Overview
This project consists of two distinct machine learning experiments designed to solve different meteorological challenges using historical data from the Open-Meteo Archive API.

### 1. Rain-or-Not (Classification)
- **Objective**: Predict if it will rain exactly **7 days after** a given input date.
- **Model**: Scikit-learn Pipeline (Experiment 1).
- **Features**: Apparent temperature, humidity, cloud cover, sunshine duration, and wind metrics.

### 2. Cumulative Precipitation (Regression)
- **Objective**: Forecast the total **cumulative precipitation (mm)** over a 3-day (72-hour) window.
- **Model**: Scikit-learn Pipeline (Experiment 2).
- **Features**: Hourly data points including soil moisture, dew point, and cloud cover at various altitudes.
